# WillowCraft E-commerce Platform

Welcome to the repository for the WillowCraft E-commerce platform! This project is designed to showcase a modern, scalable solution for online commerce using MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js).

## Project Overview

The WillowCraft E-commerce platform provides a robust solution for managing an online store. It integrates MongoDB Atlas for database services, ensuring reliable data management and scalability.

## Live Deployment

The live deployment of the application can be accessed at [WillowCraft on Vercel](https://willowcraft.vercel.app/). Please note that the backend services are not currently online, and as such, many of the functionalities (such as product manipulation and ordering) are not available at the moment.

## Features

- **Product Display**: Browse and view products that have been pre-added to the database for demonstration purposes.
- **Responsive Design**: Designed to work on both desktop and mobile platforms.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with Bootstrap for responsive design.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js.
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas for cloud database services.
